Welcome to the documentation of the OpenRefine-Wikibase reconciliation interface
================================================================================

This software offers a reconciliation interface for a Wikibase instance, following the `specifications of the reconciliation API <https://reconciliation-api.github.io/specs/latest/>`_.

This manual is intended for developers and Wikibase administrators. Reconciliation users should instead refer to the main page of the corresponding reconciliation endpoint, where user documentation can be found. For Wikidata, this is available at
`https://wikidata.reconci.link/ <https://wikidata.reconci.link>`_.
