Documenting
===========

This manual is written using Sphinx and the source files can be found in the `docs` folder
of the repository for this application.
Any contribution to the docs are of course most welcome, as are any suggestions to improve
the coverage of a particular subject.

In addition to this manual for developers, each reconciliation service instance offers user docs
on its main page.
